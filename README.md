# **Challenge:**

Many tools help employers find the right employees, but few help individuals find roles where they can thrive. Thereâ€™s also a lack of data to help predict job satisfaction in different roles.

# **Solution:**

We're developing a system that uses AI to analyze resumes and LinkedIn profiles, along with job information, to predict if someone will be happy in a job. The process involves:

Collecting Data: Gathering information from LinkedIn, job boards, and employee surveys.
Building a Model: Analyzing job descriptions and career histories to find what leads to job satisfaction.
Improving Over Time: Updating the model with new data and feedback to make it more accurate.

# **Impact:**

This tool will make it easier for people to make smart career choices:

Better Career Decisions: Helps individuals from students to professionals choose careers they will enjoy.
Tailored Education: Schools can use the data to help students prepare for satisfying careers.
Better Job Matching: Employers get employees who are happier and more likely to stay long-term.
Economic Benefits: Reduces job mismatches and helps the job market run more smoothly.
This system aims to guide people towards careers where they are both successful and satisfied, benefiting everyone in the job market.
