# **Challenge:**

There are a lot of tools and processes for helping employers find talented individuals, but there arenâ€™t that many resources for helping individuals figure out which roles they will thrive in.  There also may not be publicly available data that can be used to create a model for how well individuals thrive in a given role. 

# **Solution:**

Develop an analysis process that can predict whether an individual will gain satisfaction from a given role at a given company based on their resume/linkedIn history and the available information about the company or job.  

# **Impact:**

This tool could be useful for anyone looking to make a career decision from what to study in college to whether to go back to school, or make a career transition.  This would reduce years of wasted time and effort from both employees and employers seeking to find someone who is a good fit for their role.
